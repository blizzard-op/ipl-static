        <p>For our next live event, the tournament will feature a format completely new to the League of Legends competitive scene. Featuring an open qualifier bracket, teams will have the ability to sign up and qualify into a group stage, live at the event.

        The tournament will be broken up into 4 groups, with the groups featuring a team from each of our different qualifiers: North America, Europe, Asia, and our live qualifier. The group stage will be used to seed into a championship bracket, with the top 2 teams of the group moving into the winners bracket, and the bottom 2 teams starting from the losers bracket.</p>

          <p>
            The winner of IPL4 and IPL Face Off, TSM is still the team to beat in North America. With their various high placings in online tournaments, TSM continues to use strong team play and their vast experience to demolish the competition. Though they fell short in the Season 2 World Championships, they have incredible promise coming into IPL5.

        <p>
          The Wild Card Qualifiers bring the IPL4 runners-up back to Vegas. CLG Prime is one of the most well known LoL teams worldwide, spent extensive time in Korea training, and look to destroy the competition with their new support player and European brother team.

        <p>
          The winner of Gamescom and often considered the best team in the world, Moscow 5 continues to destroy their opponents and astonish spectators. With their strong mechanics and interesting strategies, Moscow 5 is one of the favorites to win IPL5.

          <p>
            Team Curse's North American division fell short in qualifiers but following TSM.Evo's disbanding they have inherited the spot and look to flaunt their playboy style in Vegas. Will failing to qualify for Season 2 World Championships light the competitive fire or has relaxing in the team mansion made the team soft?

          <p>
            On the opposite end of Team Curse, the European division reignited their competitive spark winning the last European qualifier after roster changes. The European team also fell short qualifying for Season 2 World Championships but have been looking at IPL5 as a chance for redemption and to perhaps surpass their brother team.

         <p>
          Team Dynamic has grown by leaps and bounds since their debut at IPL4 when they were still known as Monomaniacs. A temporary roster change questioned Dynamic's team cohesion but all the boys are back and ready to return to the tournament that launched their e-sport careers.

          <p>
            World Elite is one of the few Asian teams that have become a recognizable name in the North American LoL community. With continued domination across all of China despite recent roster changes, World Elite shows  why they are revered as one of the top teams in Asia.

          <p>
            Singapore Sentinels have been on the downturn; falling short at IPL Face Off and failing to qualify for Season 2 World Championships. This is going to be the last live event for the Sentinels before members start leaving the team for military service. IPL5 is an all or nothing event for Singapore.

          <p>
            Despite minimal international experience, Taipei Assassins have dominated the unknown at the Season 2 World Championships. Known for their work ethic and solid team coordination, Taipei Assassins are ready to continue their dominance on American soil.

          <p>
           Team Alternate is home to the most skilled individual players in Europe. The team lineup is almost entirely brand new and became sponsored after achieving their qualifying spot. This is the first time Alternate will be playing on international soil - can leader board rankings translate to tournament winnings?

          <p>
           Formerly known as Monomaniac Ferus, Team Fear is one of the most consistent performers in North America. The bottom lane of MuffinQT and Aphromoo are no strangers to the IPL stage, winning the IPL4 qualifiers under the v8 eSports banner last time around. Now with a brand new sponsor, Fear looks to turn the consistent placings into tournament wins.

          <p>
            Black Bean from Thailand is on the warpath. Dropping only one game to the Garena sponsored Bangkok Titans, Black Bean surfed over a massive 20+ game win streak during qualifiers to earn their spot in Vegas. Performance at the Season 2 SEA Regionals do speak to the inexperience outside of their native server, but the #1 team from Thailand still encourages the competition to watch their backs.

            iCeLand (Hong Kong) – A team voted into qualifiers by fans, iCeLand shook up the Hong Kong qualifiers not dropping a single game to the established, sponsored, and invited Hong Kong teams. iCeLand are the biggest unknowns coming in to IPL5 with little tournament experience but mystery on their side.

          <p>
            The Korean invasion is coming to the IPL LoL stage. Azubu Blaze, the original OGN The Champions winners, upset their brother team Frost on the way to their qualifier spot. They are the heavy favorites coming in to Vegas along with their new top lane player.
