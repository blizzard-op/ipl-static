      <h2>IPL5 is coming back to Sin City on 11.29 with a $100,000 ShootMania tournament!</h2>
      
      <div class="grid_3rds">
        <p>IGN Pro League is thrilled to announce the addition of a $100,000 ShootMania tournament at our next live event, IPL5 at the Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas! ShootMania, developed by Ubisoft's Nadeo studio, is a fast-paced first-person shooter for PC that combines adrenaline-pumping gameplay with simple, clean user controls that make it easy for anyone to pick up and play! This ShootMania tournament marks IGN Pro League's first foray into the field of FPS competition and we are very excited to see how the competition unfolds. Elite mode will be the official mode used for the tournament, which is played by two teams of three players each and is a return to classic FPS action that is great for players and spectators alike!</p>
      </div>
      <div class="grid_3rds">
        <p>
         ShootMania is being developed with eSports in mind. While the game is still in beta, new eSports-friendly features are being added constantly. Maps and even new game modes can be created easily by the community as the game progresses! There will be two qualifying teams from Europe, four qualifying teams from North America, one special invited team, and an open Wild Card qualifier that will be determined at the event itself! These eight teams will be placed into two groups, with the top two advancing to a four-team playoff bracket, playing for the lion's share of the $100,000 prize pool!

        The tournament will be broken up into 4 groups, with the groups featuring a team from each of our different qualifiers: North America, Europe, Asia, and our live qualifier. The group stage will be used to seed into a championship bracket, with the top 2 teams of the group moving into the winners bracket, and the bottom 2 teams starting from the losers bracket.</p>
